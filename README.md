# Bullseye Application
This is an example application to demonstrate creation of a simple game written completely in Swift using SwiftUI. Slide the slider along its track to approximate the random target value. Get bonus points for being on target or within 2 points of the target value. The game keeps track of the current score and the number of rounds played.  Thereâ€™s  also a simplified leaderboard feature.

The source code contains XCTests to test the game engine behavior.

Works on iPhone, iPad touch, and iPad in portrait or landscape orientation.
